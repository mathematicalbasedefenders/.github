# Yet another math game

Follow mistertfy64 on his journey to make the most feature-creeped, bloated, complicated and boring math game ever.

Literally no funding<sup>(note 1)</sup>, no endorsements<sup>(note 2)</sup>, no advertising<sup>(note 3)</sup>, and no players<sup>(note 4)</sup>.

Also if you played it you know it has bad design.

## Footnotes
<sup>(note 1)</sup>This project was funded by Thailand's [National Science and Technology Development Agency](https://nstda.or.th/) from their National Software Contest competitions, but that seems like "forced", since it was a competition.

<sup>(note 2)</sup>This project was "endorsed" by Thailand's National Science and Technology Development Agency, to an extent. mistertfy64 used it as a way to get credibility. (which is valid (self denial))

<sup>(note 3)</sup>mistertfy64 actually advertised (i.e., made a Facebook post about it, and that's it) this in a local game developer group. It did bring new players, but it didn't seem to retain any. But thank you to everyone who checked it out.

<sup>(note 4)</sup>This game (official server) does have players. But no one (in the registered player playerbase) actually plays it on a basis.
